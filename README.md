The inspiration from this project came from traditional brick breaker games, which we wanted a challenge in creating a classic game.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to download a release version of this program and to learn how to install it.

### Prerequisites

Current versions work exclusively on Linux.

Please be patient as release versions are coming for Windows.

<br>

It is possible to compile the main.c file for use on Windows.

You can download the Repository from [here](https://github.com/brick-breaker/brickBreaker/tree/chase-development)

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compile-a-c-program-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2017) to compile the file with Visual Studios


### Installing

Follow these instructions to unpackage and install releases found on our [release page](https://github.com/CThompson01/christmas-eve-eve/releases).
[Latest Stable Release](https://github.com/CThompson01/christmas-eve-eve/releases/tag/v0.1.1-alpha)

After downloading open a terminal

```
On Linux this can typically be done by pressing ctrl+alt+t

```

Navigate to your download location. Typically in your downloads folder.

```
cd Downloads/
```

Now unpackage the tar file. 

If you have a different release version, replace the "0.1" with the correct version.

```

```

Now navigate to the unpackaged files.

Again if you have a different release version, replace the "0.1" with the correct version.

```

```

Run the configure file to configure the program to your system.
If your system is unable to run the program it will return an error message.

```
./configure
```

Now run these commands to finish installation. The second command may ask for your password in order to install properly

```
make
sudo make install
```

And it's installed! Now you can break bricks whenever you please.
